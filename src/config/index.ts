    description: `
      Hi, I’m Eashan Joshi, a driven Software Engineer and AI Researcher passionate about building intelligent, high-performance systems. With hands-on experience in developing scalable backend services, LLM-integrated applications, and cloud-native infrastructures, I specialize in creating robust tools that blend performance with innovation. From financial technology to intelligent debugging platforms, my work spans multiple domains and leverages cutting-edge frameworks like LangChain, CUDA, PySpark, and Neo4j.

      \n\n I thrive at the intersection of AI and engineering, whether designing GPU-accelerated pipelines, deploying containerized architectures, or analyzing complex dependency graphs for open-source ecosystems. My mission is to engineer systems that are both smart and resilient.

      Outside of tech, I’m an avid fitness enthusiast and endurance athlete. You’ll likely find me on Strava after a long run or exploring the latest health science podcasts to optimize both mind and body.
